# Hi, I'm Namanyay Goel

I discovered my life's joy of creating by developing software and building products at the age of 13. In high school, I loved coding until midnight to make web products for myself and my clients. I dropped out of University of Washington to dedicate myself to my passion.

I had started freelance web development in 9th grade, I got my first (and last) job at MakeUseOf as their web developer at the age of 14. I worked there for 1.5 years and continued solo freelancing for many years after that.

To take things to the next level, I co-founded my agency Dyeus at the age of 18 with my best friends. We grew to a team of 20+ and delivered web apps and mobile apps to many international clients.

In 2023, I fell in love with the amazing possibilities of generative AI. Backed by the years of experience building production-grade software for millions of happy users, I decided to say goodbye to our agency model and build something of my own.
