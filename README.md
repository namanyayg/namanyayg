# Hi, I'm Namanyay⚡

I discovered my life's joy of creating & programming at the age of 13. 

In high school, I loved coding until midnight to build web products for myself and my clients. 

I had started freelance web development in 9th grade, I got my first job at MakeUseOf as their web developer at the age of 14. I worked there for 1.5 years and continued solo freelancing for many years after that.

To take things to the next level, I co-founded my agency Dyeus at the age of 18 with my best friends. We grew to a team of 20+ and delivered web and mobile apps to many international clients.

At the age of 24, I took a sabbatical and decided that I had worked enough for clients. Backed by the years of experience building production-grade software for millions of happy users, I started working on my own prducts.

Since then, I've been write software that makes AI do the boring stuff, so humans can focus on what truly matters.
