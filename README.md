# Hi, I'm Namanyay⚡

I fell in love with programming when I was 13 and started getting paid for it when I was 14. Built a dev agency & ran it for 10 years.

I write about dev and AI. I've had 4M+ views along with being covered in NYT, Futurism, Inc Magazine, and more: https://nmn.gl/blog

My mission now is to help software dev teams ship faster with AI with https://gigamind.dev/
