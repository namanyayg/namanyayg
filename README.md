# Hi, I'm Namanyay Goel

I discovered my life's joy of creating by developing software and building products at the age of 13. 

In high school, I loved coding until midnight to make web products for myself and my clients. 

I dropped out of University of Washington to dedicate myself to my passion.

I had started freelance web development in 9th grade, I got my first (and last) job at MakeUseOf as their web developer at the age of 14. I worked there for 1.5 years and continued solo freelancing for many years after that.

To take things to the next level, I co-founded my agency Dyeus at the age of 18 with my best friends. We grew to a team of 20+ and delivered web apps and mobile apps to many international clients.

At the age of 24, I [hit my financial independence milestone](https://twitter.com/NamanyayG/status/1786049433324462278).

 Since then, I've been playing with AI for fun & profit.
